# Conversation Robustness Test Suite

Comprehensive testing framework for validating chat endpoint conversation management capabilities, targeting ChatGPT/Claude.ai level performance.

## 🎯 Overview

This test suite evaluates the chat system's ability to:
- Maintain context across extremely long conversations (50-100+ turns)
- Handle complex multi-topic discussions with topic switching
- Classify intents accurately across conversation types
- Manage memory and thread detection effectively
- Provide relevant responses in specialized contexts

**Solution**: Ensure chat server is running with `python src/main.py`

**Test Timeout Errors**
```bash
❌ Error sending message: Request timeout
```
**Solution**: Increase timeout value or check server performance

**Memory/Performance Issues**
```bash
⚠️ High memory usage detected during long conversations
```
**Solution**: Monitor Redis memory usage and conversation cleanup

### Debug Mode
Add `--debug` flag for verbose output:
```bash
python run_all_conversation_tests.py --debug
```

## 📈 Performance Expectations

- **Intent Classification**: > 85% accuracy
- **Thread Detection**: > 80% topic boundary accuracy
- **Memory Usage**: < 500MB for 100+ turn conversations

### Scaling Considerations
- **Short Conversations** (< 10 turns): ~100ms processing
- **Medium Conversations** (10-30 turns): ~500ms processing  
- **Long Conversations** (30+ turns): ~1-2s processing

## 🧰 Extension & Customization

1. Create scenario dictionary with conversation turns
2. Specify expected intents and topics
3. Add to appropriate test file
4. Update test runner configuration

### Custom Metrics
Extend `analyze_conversation_quality()` in main test runner:
```python
def custom_analysis(conversation_data: Dict) -> Dict:
    # Add your custom analysis logic
    return analysis_results
```

### Integration with CI/CD
```yaml
# .github/workflows/conversation-tests.yml
- name: Run Conversation Tests
  run: |
    python src/main.py &
    sleep 10
    python tests/conversation-robustness-tests/run_all_conversation_tests.py
```

## 📝 Contributing

1. Follow existing test scenario patterns
2. Include expected intents and topics
3. Add comprehensive documentation
4. Test with various conversation lengths
5. Validate against performance benchmarks

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The chat system passes robustness testing when:
